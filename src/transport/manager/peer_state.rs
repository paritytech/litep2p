/// # State Machine
///
/// ## [`PeerState::Disconnected`]
///
/// Initially, the peer is in the [`PeerState::Disconnected`] state without a
/// [`PeerState::Disconnected::dial_record`]. This means the peer is fully disconnected.
///
/// Next states:
/// - [`PeerState::Disconnected`] -> [`PeerState::Dialing`] (via [`PeerState::dial_single_address`])
/// - [`PeerState::Disconnected`] -> [`PeerState::Opening`] (via [`PeerState::dial_addresses`])
///
/// ## [`PeerState::Dialing`]
///
/// The peer can transition to the [`PeerState::Dialing`] state when a dialing attempt is
/// initiated. This only happens when the peer is dialed on a single address via
/// [`PeerState::dial_single_address`], or when a socket connection established
/// in [`PeerState::Opening`] is upgraded to noise and yamux negotiation phase.
///
/// The dialing state implies the peer is reached on the socket address provided, as well as
/// negotiating noise and yamux protocols.
///
/// Next states:
/// - [`PeerState::Dialing`] -> [`PeerState::Connected`] (via
///   [`PeerState::on_connection_established`])
/// - [`PeerState::Dialing`] -> [`PeerState::Disconnected`] (via [`PeerState::on_dial_failure`])
///
/// ## [`PeerState::Opening`]
///
/// The peer can transition to the [`PeerState::Opening`] state when a dialing attempt is
/// initiated on multiple addresses via [`PeerState::dial_addresses`]. This takes into account
/// the parallelism factor (8 maximum) of the dialing attempts.
///
/// The opening state holds information about which protocol is being dialed to properly report back
/// errors.
///
/// The opening state is similar to the dial state, however the peer is only reached on a socket
/// address. The noise and yamux protocols are not negotiated yet. This state transitions to
/// [`PeerState::Dialing`] for the final part of the negotiation. Please note that it would be
/// wasteful to negotiate the noise and yamux protocols on all addresses, since only one
/// connection is kept around.
///
/// Next states:
/// - [`PeerState::Opening`] -> [`PeerState::Dialing`] (via transport manager
///   `on_connection_opened`)
/// - [`PeerState::Opening`] -> [`PeerState::Disconnected`] (via transport manager
///   `on_connection_opened` if negotiation cannot be started or via `on_open_failure`)
/// - [`PeerState::Opening`] -> [`PeerState::Connected`] (via transport manager
///   `on_connection_established` when an incoming connection is accepted)
